                <p>Like many of the great stories of American entrepreneurs, our story begins in a garage! The first
                    batch of beer was made in the spring of 2003. It wasn't good, but it sparked a passion that
                    eventually morphed into The B.R.I. </p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    Our Brewpub opened in 2014 on a 5 barrel brew house and a shoestring budget. Since then, we've been
                    making our favorite beers and serving them with delicious food from our scratch kitchen. We focus on
                    the beers that we enjoy drinking and making the kind of food we like to eat. We hope that everyone
                    else enjoys it as much as we do but in short, we do what we want!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    More than anything else, The B.R.I. is a gathering place. It's the place where friends go out
                    together on a weekend. It's where co-workers wind down their day with happy hour. Its where families
                    come to celebrate life's little victories and events. The Brewpub hold's a special place in our
                    heart. It's the town hall. It's church to some. It's where the revolution began! For thousands of
                    years, people have went to their local taverns, pubs and breweries and now our brewery is part of
                    that history.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By the end of 2016, we knew we would have to grow our operation so we began working on the current
                    expansion plans. If all goes well, we should be increasing our brewing and our seating in the fall
                    of 2017. The beer will be made on that same 5 barrel system we started on and the beers will be
                    developed just like they were when we were still in the garage. Slow and methodical; with a little
                    bit of science, a little bit of artistry and a metric shit ton of passion!
                </p>
                <br>



                <p>
                    At the end of every day we're just two guys that wanted to open a brewery. We love what we do and we
                    hope you do too!


                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Cheers!
